## __Why it is interesting:__ 
This article is about a software engineering project, so hopefully this is allowed. The article is interesting because I don't think anyone fully foresaw the effects that the cloud would have on software development when the public first became aware of it. It seems so intuitive that you could stream necessary code and resources now that the article has been published and consumed, but it's quite impressive that these software engineers conceived and produced this idea in the first place. This 'app streaming' software reduced the space taken up by storage heavy gaming apps on an Android phone by 85%, which is incredible. This kind of storage reduction is extremely useful and really opens up the mobile space for more development.
